# The Scrimba Weekly Challenge
These are my submissions for the weekly challenges on Scrimba where every week, a web development challenge is released for you to complete! If you are interested in starting this challenge for yourself, you can sign up for it [here](https://weeklychallenge.scrimba.com/).

## Rating Maker 
- The goal of this one was to make an app where you can rate something. You press 1-5 on your keyboard, and you will see a rating message.

## Social Media Input

- The goal was to make a tweeting application where when you enter text in a box, you can see a character count. If you exceed the limit, the button is disabled. You can also send a tweet from this application.
